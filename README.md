# livestreamIO

This is an app to livestream and play videos!

Twitch is my favorite app so I decided to start figuring out how to make something like it.

Currently working on the video component

Frontend: Typescript/React 

Backend: Express, PostgreSQL, Node

Features:
- Fullscreen
- Play or Pause the video either by clicking the video or the Play/Pause buttons
- Scrub bar so you can choose to view a certain point in the video
- Replay button
- Upload to AWS servers through drag and drop feature

Features I am building right now:
- volume controls
- Safari support (Fullscreen API doesnt like Safari :/)

Video Component:

(FullScreen Mode)
